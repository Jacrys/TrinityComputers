    <h3>I am a sole developer offering integration with Open Data, Systems Integration with existing proprietary development solutions, business process automation/streamlining, and blending of web and traditional development solutions to create a seamless interface for employee interaction. This assists in employee retention due to lower attrition from confusion/difficulty memorizing the different systems, decreases time to complete across the board, and provides a more confident face to employees as a whole. </h3>
